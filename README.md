# Electrical Submersible Pump Condition Monitoring and Forecasting
## Next Gen Technologies at Scale

Using cutting edge technologies, we will be building an IOT edge computing solution that will monitor health of ESP sensors
to identify system stress and optimize hardware longevity.

## Rules

To get started with the rules engine, let's deploy the prepared rules to our cluster:

```
$ ./bin/start.sh
```

This will import the necessary imagestreams, build our source code, stage our OpenShift manifests, and start building our
image.
