= Lab 5: Testing Updated Rules

== Business Rules
Lets replay the ESP data from beginning to verify the updated rules will trigger the alert so corrective action can be taken.

Use the instructions from the previous lab to reset the ESP data using Kafka offset-reset functionality.

Check the GUI to see if the pump 4 will trigger the alert when temperature and vibration thresholds are reached.
