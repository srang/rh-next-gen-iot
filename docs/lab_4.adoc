= Lab 4: Business Rules Service

== Business Rules
One of the important ways to monitor ESP health is by triggering an action if the sensor data meets a certain condition as defined by business rules. In this section we’ll learn how to create a business rules service. This service will work the following way:

1. Sensor data is read from a defined message queue.??
2. Sensor data is handed over to the rules execution engine that triggers action per defined rules. In our case, there is a field 'unhealthy-pump-decision' which will be changed to:
- '2' if sensor value is too high
- '1' if the sensor value  is above operating range
- '0' if the sensor value is within operating range.

Altered data is placed into another defined message queue.??

The rules syntax is pretty simple: +
If +
   some condition +
then +
   some action

For our lab, we will create the decision table via a web front-end, provided by Decision Manager Node (DMN).


== DMN

As a business analyst or business rules developer, you can use Decision Model and Notation (DMN) to model a decision service graphically in a decision requirements diagram (DRD). This diagram traces business decisions from start to finish, with each decision node drawing logic from DMN model decision elements such as decision tables.

For this lab, our DMN model will use two elements: Input data (pump telemetry data) and decision (logic for determining pump condition).

=== Decision Table
A decision table is a visual representation of one or more rules in a tabular format. Each rule consists of a single row in the table, and includes columns that define the conditions and outcome for that particular row.

=== Using DMN
DMN is available from Business Central portal that allows visual composition of custom business rules and processes.

Click on Routes in the left OpenShift Console to access the Business Central portal

=== Create DMN Decision Table

Click on Add project +

Give the project a name *esp_rules* +

In the next screen, click on *Add Assets* +

Select DMN as the type of asset +

Put name of DMN as pump_rules

Using the design Palette on the left side, select oval Input node

image::dm-dmn-input-node.png[]

Name this node as "type"

Using the Property panel on the top right corner, set the output data type to "string"

image::dm-dmn-node-property.png[]

Using the design Palette on the left side, select another Input node

Name this node as "value"

Using the Property panel on the top right corner, set the output data type to "number"

Save the model.

Using the design Palette on the left side, select rectangle Decision node

Name this node as "unhealthy-pump-decision"

Using the Property panel on the top right corner, set the output data type to "number"

We need to attach both Input nodes, type and value, to Decision node. We can do this by clicking on an Input node, clicking on its arrow icon, and attaching the arrow to the Decision node.

Click on *unhealthy-pump-decision* to highlight Decision node and then click on edit

Select the expression Decision Table to create a boxed expression implemented as a decision table.

Create the rules in the decision table

The healthy operating range of the pumps is as follows:

[cols="4",options="header"]
|=======
|Sensor Type        |Normal  |Caution           |Danger
|`temperature`      |`<200`  |`>=200 and <250`  |`>250`
|`vibration`        |`<2.7`  |`>=2.2 and <4`    |`>4`
|=======

CAUTION: When defining a range, use `[` for lower limit and `)` for upper limit

TIP: You can right click on a row to insert another rule

The table should look like the following

Once the rules are updated, click *save*

IMPORTANT: Make sure the namespace for pump_rules DMN (under properties) is listed as pump_rules

With our decision table updated, we can now package our DMN model in a Deployment Unit (KJAR) and deploy it on the Execution Server.

In the bread-crumb navigation in the upper-left corner, click on *esp_rules* to go back to the project’s Library View.

Click on the Deploy button in the upper-right corner of the screen. This will package our DMN mode in a Deployment Unit (KJAR) and deploy it onto the Execution Server (KIE-Server).
