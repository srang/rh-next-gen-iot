= Lab 4: Deploy the Lab Manager

The final portion of the overall solution is a component called Lab Manager.

== Lab Manager Overiew

 Lab Manager is a responsible for providing multiple key aspects to support the overall solution:

 * Software based sensor generator
 * Manages persistence for final results from the rules processing
 * User interface for visualizing processed data

== Deploy the Lab Manager

A script has been provided (`bin/deploy-manager.sh`) to simplifty the deployment of the Lab Manager application. Similar to our provisioning process, the script makes use of an OpenShift template located at `lab-manager/templates/lab-manager.yml`. Review the template to assess the OpenShift objects that will be created as part of the instantiation of the template.

The application includes the set of sample sensor metrics that will simulate the actual environment. These resources are located in the `lab-manager/src/main/resources/data` directory.

Now, execute the script to retrieve the source code from Git, build a container image, and finally deploy the application to OpenShift.

[source,bash]
----
$ bin/deploy-manager.sh
----

Once the application has been deployed, the software sensor will begin to emit data to AMQ and through the rest of the integration.

== Accessing the User Interface

To visualize the data that has been sent by the software simulator and processed through the Camel, AMQ and Decision Manager components, a Patternfly based UI app can be used to monitor the pump status.

The application will show the telemetry data and description of the selected ESP. It also shows the health status of each pump. If a pump is not working within its operating range, then an alert will be shown so corrective action can be taken.

An OpenShift Route has been created as part of the previously instantiated template. Determine the URL of the route by executing the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ export LAB_MANAGER_URL=http://$(oc get routes lab-manager -n user1 --template='{{ .spec.host }}')
$ echo $LAB_MANAGER_URL
----

Launch a web browser and navigate to the URL previously retrieved
