= Lab 0: Lab Environment & Resources

== Lab Environment

This lab utilizes Red Hat Product Demo System (RHPDS) to provision the lab environment.
RHPDS  uses Red Hat CloudForms to deploy infrastructure needed for our lab. +

The infrastructure consists of 5 VMs as well as the overall network configuration. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.0 has already been deployed for this lab.

OpenShift environment for this lab consists of the following systems:

[cols="3",options="header"]

|Hostname              |Internal IP    |Description
|`bastion.example.com` |`192.168.0.5`  | Bastion host
|`master.example.com`  |`192.168.0.10` | Master
|`node01.example.com`  |`192.168.0.11` | Node 01
|`node02.example.com`  |`192.168.0.12` | Node 02

From the pull-down menu, select the lab *T9FA81: Next-gen Technologies at scale: Building solutions to manage tomorrow's workloads*

Put in the provided activation key and your email address

=== Access Lab environment

Interaction with the environment will be facilitated using several mechanisms listed below:

=== OpenShift CLI

OpenShift features a Command Line Interface for interacting with the Platform. The executable has been already installed and is available from the bastion host.

Login to OpenShift with the following credentials

User: *admin* +
Password: *r3dh4t1!*

[source,bash]
----
oc login api.cluster-<GUID>.sandbox??.opentlc.com:8443 +
----

You will see a warning related to insecure certificates. Given that this is a lab environment, it is OK to safely ignore these warnings. Type **Y** and hit Enter.

If successful, you will see the following output:

[source,bash]
----
Login successful.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>

Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.
----

The OpenShift CLI has been successfully configured and ready for use in the lab!

=== OpenShift Web Console

OpenShift features a rich user interface for managing resources on the platform.

Open a web browser and navigate to the following location

link:https://console-openshift-console.apps.cluster-<GUID>.sandbox??.opentlc.com:8443[OpenShift Web console]

Similar to the CLI, a warning will appear stating that insecure certificates are being utilized. Ignore the certificate warning and continue on to the login page.

Once again, use the following credentials at the login page

User: *admin* +
Password: *r3dh4t1!*

The OpenShift catalog should be shown upon successful authentication

=== Lab Resources

The primary source of content for this lab is the IoT Next Gen Technologies at Scale project repository.

*Project location:* link:https://add_url]

Navigate to the `/home/lab-user` folder and clone the lab repository. Once cloned navigate into the `xx` directory:

[source,bash]
----
[TODO] --update instructions

$ cd /home/lab-user
$ git clone https://add_url


$ cd iot-serverless
----

The repository contains the following resources:

* *xx*
* *AMQ Online*
* *Rules*
* *Routes* ('deploy-routes'): A helper script for deploying changes to the `./message-ingestion/Streams-Reader.java` camel route to the
cluster has been provided in `./bin/deploy-routes.sh`
* *Software Sensor* (`iot-serverless-software-sensor`): Simulated software sensor representing ESP
* *Data Visualization* (`xx`): UI application to display values transmitted by IoT assets
