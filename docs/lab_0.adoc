= Lab 0: Lab Environment & Resources

== Lab Environment
This lab utilizes Red Hat Product Demo System (RHPDS) to provision the lab environment.
RHPDS  uses Red Hat CloudForms to deploy infrastructure needed for our lab. +

The infrastructure consists of 5 VMs as well as the overall network configuration. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 has already been deployed for this lab.

OpenShift environment for this lab consists of the following systems:

[cols="3",options="header"]

NOTE: It takes ~30 minutes for lab to be provisioned and become accessible. You can get real-time status of the lab environment at https://www.opentlc.com/rhpds-status

You will be getting an email with information about how to access the lab environment.

The email will also provide the unique GUID needed to access the lab environment.

== Access Lab environment

Interaction with the environment will be facilitated using several mechanisms listed below:

=== OpenShift CLI

OpenShift features a Command Line Interface for interacting with the Platform. The executable has been already installed and is available from the bastion host.

Login to OpenShift with the following credentials

User: *admin* +
Password: *r3dh4t1!*

[source,bash]
----
oc login infranode-<GUID>.generic.opentlc.com:8443 +
----

You will see a warning related to insecure certificates. Given that this is a lab environment, it is OK to safely ignore these warnings. Type **Y** and hit Enter.

If successful, you will see the following output:

[source,bash]
----
Login successful.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>

Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.
----

The OpenShift CLI has been successfully configured and ready for use in the lab!

=== OpenShift Web Console

OpenShift features a rich user interface for managing resources on the platform.

Open a web browser and navigate to the following location

link:https://infranode-<GUID>.generic.opentlc.com:8443[https://infranode-<GUID>.generic.opentlc.com:8443]

Similar to the CLI, a warning will appear stating that insecure certificates are being utilized. Ignore the certificate warning and continue on to the login page.

Once again, use the following credentials at the login page

User: *admin* +
Password: *r3dh4t1!*

The OpenShift catalog should be shown upon successful authentication
