= Business Use Case: IoT

== IoT Overview

IDC defines Internet of Things (IoT) as a network of uniquely identifiable end points (or ‘things’) that communicate bi-directionally without human interaction using IP connectivity. For businesses, IoT can create new opportunities to connect with customers and achieve operational efficiencies. IoT has potential to transform entire industries from transportation, retail, oil & gas, utilities to stadiums.

Vast numbers of endpoints (smart sensors, GPS devices, pumps), will generate massive volume of data. Once data from millions of devices is collected, it needs to be acted on immediately or transformed, summarized and stored to be acted on later.

=== Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) Condition Monitoring and Forecasting

Using cutting edge technologies, we will be building an IOT edge computing solution that will monitor health of ESP
to identify system stress and optimize hardware longevity.

## ESP Overview

More than 90% of producing oil wells require some form of artificial lift to bring oil or gas to the surface. This is common for mature fields when the reservoir pressure has been depleted through production. ESP (Electrical Submersible Pump) is the  second-most common artificial lift method worldwide with more than 100k ESPs in operation. ESP operate in
a hostile environment and face  challenges like high-gas volume wells, produced solids, and high-temperature and corrosive environments.

Monitoring vital statistics of ESP helps reduce the risk of debilitating problems that lower life its  expectancy.
Real-time monitoring of ESP can help increase the ROI of the multi-billion dollar investment in a well; e.g. for a 1000 pumps producing ~200 BOE/day (barrel of oil equivalent), could cost ~$20M/year in lost production. Real time pump surveillance can not only monitor how ESP is behaving but also find well problems that are unrelated to the pump itself.

Basic ESP system comprises of an electric motor, a protector, gas separator, multi-stage centrifugal-pump,  power cable, motor controller, transformers and a power source. Sensors in downhole transmit streams of data on pressure, temperature, vibration, current and voltage back to the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems.

The key to successful monitoring is to know which parameters to measure and how to effectively interpret this data. The complex interactions between the wellbore and an ESP can be analyzed using trend plots to tell story of pump or Gradient Traverse plot analysis to highlight the hierarchy of measured parameters and show how these parameters can be used to validate well and ESP performance.

=== Monitoring Temperature and Vibration
Vibration and temperature are two of the many parameters available to assist with the diagnosis of ESP systems in order to optimize runlife. Like any other variable, these should always be used in conjunction with other downhole and surface measurements in order to obtain a complete picture of the pump and well performance.

Downhole rotating systems, such as ESPs, are complex systems where vibration can be introduced in many ways. In the case of an ESP, vibration can be induced due to imbalance in the pump or motor, wear in the pump diffusers or impellers, manufacturing problems, electrical power instability or as result of the fluids being produced through the pump.

=== Rules based decision making
In the use case for this lab, we’ll use simple rules on vibration and temperature data to establish leading indicators of failure and prevent the pump from operating in an undesirable condition. Once a specific threshold is reached, alert can be raised to change pump parameters or shut it down safely.
