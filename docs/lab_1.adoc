= Lab 1: Initial Seeding

Resources (both cluster and local) can be seeded using the script `./bin/system-int.sh`

To get started with the lab, let's deploy the prepared resources to our cluster:

----
$ ./bin/start.sh
----

This will import the necessary imagestreams, bootstrap our cluster and local environment, build our source code, stage
our OpenShift application manifests, and start building our images.


NOTE: A large number of resources will be created. It will take a few minutes to each of the resources to fully deploy to the OpenWhisk project.

* Use watch command to monitor the progress:

[source,bash]
----
$ watch oc get pods
----

Once all pods are in the “Running” or “Completed state”, hit CTRL+C to break the “watch” command. +

NOTE: Pods may initially report in Error status. This condition should resolve itself in a few moments.

* Check the status of deployment:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get pods

NAME                                          READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
----



== Verify OpenWhisk Deployment using OpenShift web console

* Navigate to the following url in the browser:

TIP: OpenShift web UI access url is provided in the screen splash when you ssh into the system

* Click on the project name (xx) in the upper right corner. A successful deployment will look like the following:
