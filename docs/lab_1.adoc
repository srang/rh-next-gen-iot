= Lab 1: Business Rules Service

The OpenShift environment that has been provisioned for you already contains a portion of the overall solution. In this first lab, you will start to to build out the remainder of the infrastructure to support the overall solution. 

== Reviewing the Existing Environment

As you saw in Lab 0, you have access to two projects: `kafka` and `user1`. The `kafka` project contains the entire ecosystem of AMQ Streams including a Kakfa broker. 

The remainder of the resources that have either been deployed as part of the preconfigured environment as well as the deployments that you will execute as part of this workshop will be exectued in the `user1` project.

The following table depicts the components preinstalled within OpenShift.

== Camel K Infrastructure Setup

Camel K allows you to create lightweight integrations on OpenShift and Kubernetes. Like the majority of components in OpenShift 4, it is managed by an Operator. Your job is to deploy the operator which will enable integrations to be utilized. The management of Camel K resources is managed using an executable binary called `kamel` which has also been preinstalled on your workstation.

. To deploy the operator, execute the following command
+
[source,bash]
----
$ kamel install --skip-cluster-setup -n user1
----
+
. Confirm the operator pod is present in the list of running pods in the `user1` project
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc get pods -n user1
----

== Deploying the Camel Bridge

Even though Camel K is being used for a portion of the overall solution, there are circumstances for which a traditional Camel based application may be preferred. Examples include responding to events that do not require a persistent connection. The bridge application that we will be deploying allows for messages originating in a standalone AMQ broker running on OpenShift to be passed to a Kafka topic. The contents of the bridge application are found in the `message-bridge` directory of the project directory. The Camel route using Java DSL format can be found in the `message-bridge/src/main/java/com/redhat/iot/AmqpKafkaBridge.java` file. Review the contents of this file to investigate the integration.

The `bin/deploy-bridge.sh` script is available which not only abstracts the building of the image for the application along with the deployment itself, but also confirms the deployment occurred successfully. The script invokes an Openshift template containing all of the resources that are to be applied to the OpenShift environment. 

Take a moment to inspect the contents of the `message-bridge/templates/message-bridge.yml` template.

Execute the script to apply the template which in turn will build a new image from the source code from the git repository and deploy the application from within the root of the git repository cloned locally

[source,bash]
----
$ bin/deploy-bridge.sh
----

Confirm the messafge-bridge pod is running in the `user1` project

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get pods -n user1
----

In the next lab, you will deploy the core components to finalize the deployment of the solution to complete an end to end solution.
