#Intro

In this lab, we will be working with cutting edge technology to build an IOT edge computing solution that will monitor
health of ESP sensors to identify system stress and optimize hardware longevity. The technologies involved are:

We will be generating Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) data based on real world situations and building intelligence
into the data processing layer to identify ways to improve pump longevity.

AMQ Streams

AMQ Streams is a Java/Scala publish-subscribe-based messaging broker. Based on the Apache Kafka and Strimzi projects, it offers a distributed backbone that allows microservices and other applications to share data with extremely high throughput and extremely low latency. AMQ Streams makes it easy to run Apache Kafka on OpenShift by using OpenShift native mechanisms for:
- Provisioning the cluster
- Managing the topics and users
- Providing a better integration with applications running on OpenShift.

AMQ Online
AMQ Online gives administrators the ability to configure a cloud-native, multi-tenant messaging service either in the cloud or on-premise. Developers can use Red Hat AMQ Online to provision messaging when and where they need it with zero installation, configuration, and maintenance. The developers serve themselves from an easy to-use browser console.

Camel-K
Apache Camel K (a.k.a. Kamel) is a lightweight integration framework built from Apache Camel that runs natively on Kubernetes and is specifically designed for serverless and microservice architectures. To start using Camel K you need the "kamel" binary, that can be used to both configure the cluster and run integrations.
