#Intro

In this lab, we will be working with cutting edge technology to build an IOT edge computing solution that will monitor
health of ESP sensors to identify system stress and optimize hardware longevity. The technologies involved are:

* AMQ Streams - Red Hat distribution of Kafka built around our best-in-class messaging ecosystem
* Decision Manager - End to end business rules management platform, including authoring workbench and execution engine
* Fuse - Integration solution building off industry standard enterprise integration patterns

We will be generating Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) data based on real world situations and building intelligence
into the data processing layer to identify ways to improve pump longevity.
