= Lab 9: Visualizing the Data

== View data in UI
To visualize the data that has been sent by the software simulator and processed through Fuse and Decision Manager, a Patternfly based UI app will be deployed to monitor the pump status.

The app will show the telemetry data and description of the selected ESP. It also shows the health status of each pump. If a pump is not working within its operating range, then an alert will be shown so corrective action can be taken. The source for the frontend application is located in the `??/src/main/resources/static` folder.
