= Lab 3: Lightweight Integrations using Camel K

== Review and Deploy the Integration

Earlier, we deployed a traditional Camel based application that was running within a Spring Boot based micoservice. In this exercise, you will remove the need to build an entire application server and define a simple integration contining _only_ the business in a lightweight runtime.

=== Review the Integration

The Camel K integration for this solution is available in the `message-bridge/src/main/java/com/redhat/iot/routes/StreamsReader.java`. 

The integration performs the following steps:

1. Reads messages from a Kafka queue
2. Sends values to Decision Manager
3. Assess the results
4. Sends the results to the Lab Manager component (to be deployed in a subsequent section) for longterm storage

As you can see, all that we needed to provide is a single Camel route and Camel K will do the rest!

=== Adding Group ID when consuming from Kafka Topics

vi message-bridge/src/main/java/com/redhat/iot/routes/StreamsReader.java

In order for you to replay the messages from AMQ Streams topics, add the user group towards the end of the endpoint config

kafka:user1-data?brokers="+BROKER_URL+"&groupId=user1"

=== Deploy the Camel K Integration

Instead of needing to have OpenShift take source code from a Git based repository and create a new container image, we can use Camel K and the associated `kamel` executable to have the platform create an image for us. All that we need to do is point to the source for the integration, define any dependencies that are needed by the integration, and the platform will handle the rest.

Camel K makes use of OpenShift and Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions to define new API types within the platform. When you use the `kamel` executable, a new `Integration` type will be created within the current project. The Camel K operator that we deployed in the previous section is responsible for monitoring `Integration` resources and taking action as necessary. 

The `kamel run` command is used to create a new `Integration` object that defines all of the components that we will need. When a new `Integration` is created, the Operator retrieves the definition, creates a new container image based upon the Camel route and any other dependencies (using the `-d` parameter) that are defined and then starts the container.

Change into the directory containing the Camel K code and deploy the integration.

[source]
----
$ cd message-bridge/src/main/java/com/redhat/iot/routes
$ kamel run StreamsReader.java -d mvn:org.kie.server:kie-server-client:7.18.0.Final -d camel-kafka -d camel-jackson -d camel-http --dev -n user1
----

By passing the `--dev` parameter, we can monitor the state of the running deployment and the application logs. We will keep this window open while we work through the rest of

In another terminal window, let's review the `Integration` object that was created by the `kamel run` command

[source]
----
$ oc project user1
$ kamel get
----

The integration is operational when the _Phase_ lists as `Running`. Now, review the full output of the object
