= Lab 6a: Advanced Lab: Create new Camel route

== Camel Route
Integration is a hard problem. To help deal with the complexity of integration problems the Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) have become the standard way to describe, document and implement complex integration problems.

Camel implements the EIP easily in a few lines of code. For the previous labs, the ESP sensor data (temperature, vibration) has been combined into one topic This Camel route for this is located in the StreamsReader app located in folder: message-bridge/src/main/java/com/redhat/iot/routes

For this lab, update the existing Camel route to send ESP sensor data to different topics. 

Hints:

.choice()
        //to vibration topic
        .when().simple("${body.xxx} == 'xxx'")
            .to("xxx")
        //to temperature topic
        .otherwise()
            .to("xxx");
