= Lab 6a: Advanced Lab: Create new Camel route

== Camel Route
For the previous labs, the ESP sensor data (temperature and vibration) has been combined into one stream. This Camel route for this is located in the StreamsReader app located in folder: message-bridge/src/main/java/com/redhat/iot/routes

For this lab, create a new Camel route to separate temperature and vibration data into different streams.
