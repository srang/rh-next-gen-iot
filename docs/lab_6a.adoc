= Lab 6a: Advanced Lab: Processing more data - Create new Topics

== Kafka Topic
For the previous labs, we've been using the Kafka topic `user1-data` to receive and process the sensor data. However, sometime we want to handle it in a different way depending on the source or type of messages. So it is recommended to create different topics for this different sources of information.

=== Check your topics

You can find the list of current Kafka topics by reviewing the Kafka topic resources:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc project kafka
$ oc get kafkatopics
----

=== Create new Kafka topic

We provide a sample `kafka-topic.yaml` file under this same repository (located at advanced/amq-streams/) with the topic name to create as well as the kafka cluster name to link that topic with your actual cluster. 

You can find your Kafka cluster name by executing the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get kafka
----

NOTE: Apply the updated resource file using the OpenShft CLI.

=== Verify new topic

We have been using the CLI to review the available Kafka topics, but somethimes is better to have a more visual tool. The team is providing you with a sample console to view the current cluster information.

Deploy the Kafka console to verify that the new topic has been created. +
The configuration for Kafka console is provided in the file `amq-streams-console.yaml` (located at advanced/amq-streams/)

NOTE: You'll need to create route for the new topic
